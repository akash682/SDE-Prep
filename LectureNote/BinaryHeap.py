Tree: Heap

Most Likely we talk about Binary Heap
Every Child is larger/smaller than the parent node!
Max Heap/Min Heap

Lookup O(n)
Insert O(logN)
Delete O(logN)

Binary Heap there is no relationship or information related with left or right

Why Binary Heap?
Binary Heap are good when we want to comparative operation
I want the people that have value over 33
