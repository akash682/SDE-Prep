Arrays

Arrays: organize the data sequentially,stored in contiguous memory they have footprint
Lookup: O(1)
Push: O(1)
Insert: O(n)
Delete: O(n)

i.e.
0 Juice
1. Apple
2. Cheese
3. Kale
4. Mango

## Static Arrray vs Dynamic Array
Static Array: we need to specify the memory size of the array before storing the array
Dynamic Array: if we need to add the item we don't need to redefine again instead it dynamically adds the memory allocation
append can be O(n) because there is possibility that it appends the data and reaalocates all the elements to the new memory location.
