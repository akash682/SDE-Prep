Programs = Data Structures + Algorithms


Data Structure: Collections of value, each data structure is good in their own way and suits to certain problem types.
For example, real life container(fridge, folder, bag, drawer) has their own purpose to store certain type of objects.
we can store things like string, integer, boolean...
we try to organize the things as in the real life situation, store the apple in the fridge, store the bento in the picnic bag... etc\

Readable/Memory/Speed

1. How to build one: most of the time the data structure are already built for us 
2. How to use it: important 


## HOw to store the data
CPU: actual work, calculation, brain of the computer. 
RAM: Variables are stored in the Random Access Memory, ephemeral memory
Storage: We store, music/video/files in the storage, persistent memory

RAM: massive storage area has a address or shelves in it. Each of the shelves holds a 1 byte; tiny elctrical switch, 8 bit = 1 byte
CPU asks the RAM to get the stored data, we just need to know which shelves to get the data from
data structure is an arrangement of data like define how to interact/arranged in the RAM.

Data Structures
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queus
- Linked Lists
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Operations on Data Structues
data structure are simply a way to organize and arrange the data
each data strucutre has tradeoff some are good at something but other are not

Actions
- Access
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Sorting
