"""
LInked list has the information of Value and the pointer the next node
List is ordered Hash Table is unordered
How to make a ordered data structure with a character of hash table --> Linked List

Hast Table << LInked List
--> Ordered

Prepend O(1)
Append O(1)
Lookup O(n)
Insert O(n)
Delete O(n)

## What is a pointer?
Pointer is a reference to an another memory location
garbage collection: delete the data that is stored in memory which is not referenced by any object


## Doubly Linked List
It's the same as the LInkedList but the difference is that it has the pointer to the previous Node

## Single vs Double
Single: Merit less memory, but not reversing
Double: Can be traversed from head or the tail, the downside is complex requires memory, extra operation
