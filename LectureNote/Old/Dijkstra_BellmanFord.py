"""
Dijkstra Algorithm: Cannot take into account of negative numbers but less time complexity than BellmanFord.

BellmanFord Algorithm: It can take into account of negative value. Time complexity O(n^2)
Bellman also made the Dynamic Programming


BFS/DFS: Doesn't care about the weights for the edges.
