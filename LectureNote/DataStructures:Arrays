Store variables one after another

lookup O(1)
push O(1)
insert O(n)
delete O(n)

Static Array --> it requires to define the size of memory allocation before usage
i.e. C++ int a[20]; int b[5] {1,2,3,4,5}

Dynamic Array --> don't need to think about memory allocation before usage. the machine takes care for you. 
i.e. Python, Javascript
